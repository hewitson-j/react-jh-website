      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Jacob and I'd like to tell you a little bit about
        myself. Like you can see in the header I'm a Software Developer and
        passionate about learning. I like to learn things and gain new
        experiences. I also like to make things, and so software development has
        been one of my most favorite things I've done.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Here on this about me page I'd like to share a little bit of who I am
        and the experiences that have made me who I am, which I hope will show
        what I can bring to the table. I am a person who values finding joy and
        growth along the journey, and while results are important I also try to
        understand the human element of my work and do my best to make people
        happy while at the same time providing them what they're seeking. I've
        definitely had some interesting experiences in my life which have helped
        me to become the capable and proactive person that I strive to be today.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I am a person who sees the value in working with and helping
        people. It is said that the greatest thing one can do is to love our
        neighbors as ourselves. While this might be an idealistic viewpoint, I
        see this as a pragmatic value that I try to implement into my life. I
        feel that it is vital to care for those around us and seek to do good to
        our neighbors. Throughout history humankind has come into conflict with
        one another many times, but when we are willing to work together and
        form beneficial relationships between each other we can do great things.
        The fundamentap principle of society is working together for the
        betterment of us all, and I feel that me contributing in any way that I
        can is vital and a principle I strive to live my life by. Apart from the
        altruistic nature of this principle, I also pragmatically apply it to my
        collaborations and interactions with others, and try to listen to their
        points of view and incorporate their ideas to make the best outcome for
        all involved.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        While I believe in selfless actions done with no interest for oneself, I
        also do understand and feel it is important to take care of oneself as
        well. Whether we are more than just the sum of our actions, we need to
        make sure we our needs are taken care of, and for me that means taking
        time for myself to relax and unwind after a long day. That way I can
        clear my mind and be ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities of
        a new day.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Along with taking care of oneself, just as important is maintaining some
        sense of spirituality and mindfulness of one's place in the world. For
        me, spirituality is the road to self-actualization, and while
        traditionally spirituality is associated with a religion, for me
        spirituality is simply connecting oneself with a higher power or
        something larger than themselves. This in part takes the form of
        self-improvment and goal-setting. This inspires me to keep working to
        learn and improve and better myself. It also drives me to always give my
        best effort in everything that I do. I find peace in meditation and
        analyzing what I've done well, where I want to be, and how I can get
        there all while feeling close to the Divine as I do so.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I value honest and efficient hard work as well. I would say I
        believe in progress and improving upon what we already have. With that
        being said, there are traditional values which I believe are vital for
        said progress and diligence is a key value which I try to emulate in my
        life. At work or in my studies, when I am given a project I do my best
        to plan out what my course of action is and then diligently do as much
        as I can until the job is done or I can't do any more. If I get to the
        point where I can't do any more, I search resources to find a solution
        and if I can't I seek for help from colleagues, at which point the
        problem is usually solved.
